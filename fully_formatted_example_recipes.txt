HOT CHOCOLATE        
Mary Jo McFadden


This Hot Chocolate Recipe was prepared and served by Mary Jo McFadden when she entertained the Brunkhorst/McFadden families at Christmas. This recipe was submitted by several family members with notes attached how each would look forward to this awesome treat each year! (Note: Mary Jo is known for always typing instead of writing. She was also noted for calling her children and siblings in the morning to wish them a "good day!" Mary Jo is sadly missed by all who knew her.)


* 1 (cup) sugar        
* 1 (cup) cocoa        
* 1 (cup) water, boiling
* 1 (quart) heavy cream
* 4 (quarts) milk, scalding hot


1. Mix sugar and cocoa, stir to a smooth paste with the boiling water. Heat over the direct flame and then cook in a double boiler for about 30 minutes, or until a thick paste is formed. Chill. 
2. Whip cream. Fold in cocoa paste, scald milk in double boiler or pan, add vanilla and salt. When serving hot chocolate, put chocolate mixture in a bowl and hot milk in a pitcher. Put a large spoonful of chocolate mixture in cup: add hot milk. Be sure milk is scalding hot; otherwise beverage will be lukewarm because of the cold paste that is added. I put sugar with my whipping cream when I whip it and some vanilla too.

3. Strain again and pour into wine bottles. Let the bottles stand uncorked for 5 days. Cork or cap bottles. Let wine develop for at least 2 months.


This recipe was a  recipe of Grandma Anna Brunkhorst, submitted by granddaughter, Ann Fabric, daughter of Della Wintakger.


Note received by Vivian Shane, daughter of Della and sister to Ann: I used to 
stay during high school years with Grandma Brunkhorst in her home in
Lamont, Iowa. This was only on nights when I had special practice. At our
evening meal, Grandma served me a small glass of her homemade dandelion 
wine. Since I was a teenager and had not drank wine I was very frustrated as 
to whether I should drink it or not. Finally, I rationalized Anna was my 
mother's mother so she wouldn't serve me anything I shouldn't have. I drank 
the wine!
