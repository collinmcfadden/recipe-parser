RECIPE TITLE
Authors 


If the ingredients are listed all in one chunk, list them like so (⌘ + Shift + 8)
* Ingredient 1
* Ingredient 2




If the ingredients are in two or more subsections, list them like so (Tab + ⌘ + Shift + 7)
DOUGH
* Ingredient 1
* Ingredient 2


FILLING
* Ingredient 1
* Ingredient 2


The ingredients in the book are listed in two columns. Try to format these so that the ingredients in the first column are listed first and then list the ingredients from the second column.


For the recipe steps, format as a numbered list (⌘ + Shift + 7)
1. In the original cookbook, there weren’t numbers for the steps. Instead, all steps were listed in a single paragraph.
2. Ideally, when you format the recipe, split the sentences out into collections of steps. If nothing else, remove any unnecessary newlines, and have the steps listed all in the number one 


If the Steps are in two or more subsections, list them like so (Tab + ⌘ + Shift + 8)
DOUGH        
1. Step 1
2. Step 2


FILLING        
1. Step 1
2. Step 2


Any chunks of text containing additional recipe details can be left in the same position as they are originally, just try to remove newline characters if you see them.




Phase 2 Style Guide - 
Goals
* Make recipe ingredient values parseable
* Re-read the recipe steps to catch spelling/formatting errors


Making ingredients parsable
Want the ingredients in this format:
* Amount (unit) item name, extra details


Ex. 
* 2 (tbsp) olive oil
* 1 ½ (cups) onion, chopped 
* 1 (tbsp) fresh garlic, minced        
* 3 (6-inch) corn tortillas, cut into 1-inch pieces        
* ½ (cup) heavy cream
* 1 (10 ½ oz can) Ro-Tel tomatoes        
* salt and pepper


Amount
Whole values: 1 (cup)
Compound Fractions: 1 ½ (cups)
Fractions: ½ (cup)
Not present: salt and pepper


Unit
Surrounded by parentheses: 1 (cup)


Units that are same whether Amount is <= 1
1 (tsp) vs 2 (tsp)
1 (tbsp) vs 2 (tbsp)
1 (lb) vs 2 (lb)
1 (oz) vs 2 (oz)




Units that are different when Amount is <= 1
½ (cup) vs 1 (cup) vs 1 ½ (cups)
1 (pint) vs 2 (pints)
1 (quart) vs 2 (quarts)
1 can vs 2 cans
(most other units)


Ingredient Name
Ideally listed so that it doesn’t have any commas.  This will not be possible in all cases, such as 
* 1 red, yellow, and green apple, cut into wedges


Extra Details
Try to rewrite an extra details to be after the ingredient name. Can have additional commas/parentheses, but omit them if they aren’t adding value


Common cases:
* 4 (cups) water, boiling         
* 2 (cups) cheese, shredded
* 1 (cup) lemon juice, 4-6 lemons


Original
* 1 (large package).or 3 small packages chicken flavor Rice-a-Roni

HOT CHOCOLATE        
Mary Jo McFadden


This Hot Chocolate Recipe was prepared and served by Mary Jo McFadden when she entertained the Brunkhorst/McFadden families at Christmas. This recipe was submitted by several family members with notes attached how each would look forward to this awesome treat each year! (Note: Mary Jo is known for always typing instead of writing. She was also noted for calling her children and siblings in the morning to wish them a "good day!" Mary Jo is sadly missed by all who knew her.)

* 1 (cup) water, boiling
* 1 qt. heavy cream
* 4 qt. milk, scalding hot

Put a large spoonful of chocolate mixture in cup: add hot milk. Be sure milk is scalding hot; otherwise beverage will be lukewarm because of the cold paste that is added. I put sugar with my whipping cream when I whip it and some vanilla too.

This recipe was a  recipe of Grandma Anna Brunkhorst, submitted by granddaughter, Ann Fabric, daughter of Della Wintakger.


Note received by Vivian Shane, daughter of Della and sister to Ann: I used to 
stay during high school years with Grandma Brunkhorst in her home in
Lamont, Iowa. This was only on nights when I had special practice. At our
evening meal, Grandma served me a small glass of her homemade dandelion 
wine. Since I was a teenager and had not drank wine I was very frustrated as 
to whether I should drink it or not. Finally, I rationalized Anna was my 
mother's mother so she wouldn't serve me anything I shouldn't have. I drank 
the wine!

* 2 (cups) milk
* 1 stick margarine
* ½ (cup) lukewarm water
* 2 (packages) yeast
* ½ - ¾ (cup) sugar
* 2 (tsp) salt


1. Scald milk; take from heat and add margarine. Set aside until lukewarm.
2. Meanwhile, add yeast to lukewarm water; set aside. 
3. When the milk mixture is lukewarm, add ½ - ¾ (cup) sugar and salt, yeast mixture and several cups of flour (about 3).
4. Using a large mixing spoon, beat together well. Add enough flour to make dough stiff enough to knead. Try not to get it too stiff. Knead on pastry cloth or floured board. Let rise in a warm room until double in bulk. Knead down and make into hamburger buns - about 12 or 15 on a large cookie sheet or jelly roll pan. I usually make 12 on a pan. Be sure to flatten them as much as possible before they start to rise.
5. Let rise until light; gently, with a forefinger, press the centers down, hole about the size of a quarter.
6. Put about a teaspoon of your favorite jam in the center (apricot jam with a little lemon juice in it is good); can also use ½ cooked prunes or pureed apricots.
7. Bake in a moderate oven until light brown. Take out of the oven and while hot, frost with a powdered sugar frosting made with lemon juice and butter or margarine. Frosting shouldn't be too thick and it will melt over the rolls like a glaze.

GREAT GRANDMA DELL'S ANGEL FOOD CAKE
Alexandra Matloff


* 1 (cup) cake flour (sifted)
* ¾ (cup) fine sugar
* 1½ (cup) egg whites (approximately 12 eggs)
* 1½ (tsp) cream of tartar
* ¼ (tsp) salt
* 1½ (tsp) vanilla flavoring
* 12¼ (tsp) almond flavoring
* ¾ (cup) fine sugar


1. This mouth-watering angel food cake is made by first, combining the sifted flour with ¾ (cup) sugar and sifting four times. Then, while the oven is preheating at 375", beat together the egg whites, cream of tartar, salt and flavorings until soft peaks form.
2. Next, add the remaining ¾ (cup) of sugar, 2 (tbsp) at a time, beating the mixture after each addition of sugar. The flour and sugar combination is then folded in very, very gently and carefully. After pouring the mixture into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan, the mixture is baked at 375° for 35-40 minutes.
3. Finally, remove the cake and turn it upside down in the pan onto a large Coke bottle. In about 1½ hours, the cake will be cool. The cake is removed from the pan by running a sharp knife along the sides. Now you are ready to enjoy the most wonderful and sweetest dessert this side of heaven.


The most delicious angel food cake I have ever tasted has been handed down in my family for four generations. I call it my "Great Grandma Dell's Angel FoodCake." My great grandma Della learned to make this special angel food cake from her mother, my great-great grandma Anna, who lived in Austria. My great grandma Della loved to prepare and eat this tasty cake. Great Grandma Della was raised in a small farming town in Masonville, Iowa. She had fresh eggs from the chickens and milk from the cows that she raised on her farm. The angel food cake recipe is a favorite of mine because when I make the cake with my Grandma, she shares stories about the times when she and her mother used to make this recipe. I like to watch my Grandma crack open the twelve eggs for the cake. Sometimes she lets me crack them. The cake is used mainly on birthdays. I love the smell of the cake cooking. It reminds me of all the happy birthdays we have celebrated. I like the fluffy cake with chocolate ice cream.
This recipe and story was written by Annamae Fabric's granddaughter, Alexandra Matloff, daughter of Natalie Fabric Matloff, as an English project, November 1999.

SIMPLE GRILLED SALMON         
Diane and Luke Brunkhorst


* Salmon         
* Lemons
* Fish seasoning


1. Leave the skin on while you cook. You can eat it after it is cooked or just take the meat off with a fork. The skin has good flavor. Put lemon slices under the fish. Sprinkle or rub some fish seasoning on the top and save some lemons to squeeze over it when it is done. 
2. Cook it on tin foil (heavy duty), skin side down, on the grill, with the sides folded up. You can tell when salmon is done by testing it with a fork. It should be somewhat flaky and juicy and the color should be light pink. Try not to over cook. 8-10 minutes on a hot grill, should do it, for ½ to ¾-inch pieces.

 You add your own link to the chain, and that is where you strengthen or 
        weaken what you have been blessed ? or burdened ? with. 
That is where you use the indefinable quality that belongs to you, the bit of
uniqueness you pass on to your children for good or bad, the part ofy ou that will always be separate from those 
        who share your name, your blood and your past.

-FREEZING AND CANNING-


@@@
CANNED BEEF
Ann and Philip Brunkhorst


   1. Prepare canning jars by sterilizing canning jars. I prefer using wide mouth jars. Place ½ (tsp) salt per pint or 1 (tsp) salt per quart. Use only canning salt as table salt will leave a cloudiness in the bottom of the jar.
   2. Remove bone, gristle and most of the fat from the meat. (I use chuck roast.) Cut tender meat into chunks 1 or 2 inches thick which can be packed into canning jars. Pack tightly into jars making sure that all air bubbles are removed. Leave 1 inch headspace at top of jar. Wipe mouth of jar. Adjust jar lids.
   3. Process at 10 (lb) of pressure in pressure. Pints for 75 minutes and quarts for 90 minutes. Follow canner instructions for removal.


I have canned chicken breast and pork loin using this method also. Awesome heated and served over cooked noodles or with mashed potatoes.

MENNONITE FROZEN SWEET CORN
Kathy Klotz and Monica Piersall


   * 20 (cups) fresh sweet corn (cut from cob)
   * 1 (cup) sugar
   * Small handful salt
   * 3 sticks butter or margarine
   * 1 ½ (cups) water


   1. Cut sweet corn from cob (do not cook). Combine with sugar and salt. Put butter and water in the bottom of the pan. (This prevents corn from scorching.)
   2. Add corn mixture. Bring to a boil for 5 minutes or so. Stir to prevent scorching.
   3. Transfer to another container and immerse the container into ice water. When corn is cool, bag 
   4. in 1-qt. freezer bags. Put 2 (cups) into each bag.
   5. Lay bags flat on a 9x13-inch pan until frozen. (Laying flat in a pan until frozen makes it easier to stack in the freezer.)


The Mennonites in Milford, NE have big get-togethers to make this sweet corn.

CHOW CHOW
Edna Brunkhorst


   * 1 peck green tomatoes
   * 3 large onions
   * 3-4 (cups) sugar
   * Vinegar
   * 4-5 (tbsp) pickling spice
   * Coarse salt


   1. Cut up tomatoes; sprinkle with a handful of salt and leave overnight. In the morning, drain the brine, rinse with cold water and drain again.
   2. Add the cut up onion and some vinegar, but not enough to cover, about 3 (cups) and the pickling spice tied in a muslin bag or old nylon hose.
   3. Cook, simmering 3-4 hours. Wash jars, rinse with boiling water. Fill and seal.


This is a good relish with cold cuts, any meat, especially roast beef or pork. My mother's recipe.

BRINED CABBAGE OR MILD SAUERKRAUT
Ann Fabric


   * 8 (tsp) salt
   * 4 (lb) cabbage (prepared)


   1. Mix the shredded cabbage very carefully with the salt. Pack into sterilized 2-qt. jars. Press down the cabbage until the juice runs out and covers it. If the juice does not cover, add a weak brine made by adding 1 (tbsp) of salt to 2 (cups) of water. Hold the cabbage down under the brine by slipping 2 strips of wood, crosswise in the jar below the neck. Wipe off the top of the jar with a clean damp cloth. Place a rubber ring on top. Screw down top until it catches and no more.
   2. Set jars on an enamel tray to catch the juice that will leak out during fermentation. Let stand until fermentation ceases, which will be about 10 days. The bubbling will stop when the fermentation is over. If, at this time, the juice does not cover the cabbage, add more brine to the jar.
   3. This will keep for several weeks if transferred to a cold place. If you wish to keep it longer, the jars will have to be processed for 30 minutes in a boiling water bath.
   4. For best results you should use pure granulated salt, which is called bag salt or dairy salt. Do not use table or rock salt.
   5. If you haven't an enamel tray be sure and use old pans or trays so that it won't matter if they become rusty.
   6. For good results, use a thermometer to test the surrounding temperature and don't guess at it. Temperatures are carefully held where kraut is made on a large scale for canning.
   7. And don't guess at the amount of salt, or "think" you have 4 (lb) of shredded cabbage; actually weigh it.


This amount of cabbage will pack into a 2-qt. jar, which will help you figure out how many jars of kraut you wish to make. This recipe was used by Della Brunkhorst Wintakger and her mother Anna Brunkhorst.

PEELING KIWI FRUIT


There is a quick and simple way to peel kiwi fruit with a teaspoon. This method works best with fruit that is ripe but not too soft. First cut off both ends of a kiwi. Then slip a teaspoon just under the skin, matching the spoon's curve to the curve of the fruit. Now slide the spoon around the kiwi to separate the fruit from the skin, being careful not to dig into the flesh. Once the spoon has been completely run around the fruit, it will easily slip out of the skin in one smooth
piece!
